### Day 1 Explanation

**Input**:  
`s = "abcdefg", k = 3, fill = "x"`

**Goal**: Divide the string into chunks of 3.  
If the last part is too short, fill it with "x".

**Output**:  
`["abc", "def", "gxx"]`

**Key Concepts**:
- `.slice(start, end)` to extract a part of the string
- `.repeat(n)` to fill missing characters
- `for` loop with `i += k` to move in chunks
